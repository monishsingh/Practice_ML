Last year, the Corps ordered 47,000 acres of new wetlands, which is
more than the 31,000 acres they allowed to be damaged.The new rules require developers to obtain federal permits for
any construction projects, including individual homes, on wetlands.Seven
states, it said, have lost more than 80 percent of their original
wetlands.
